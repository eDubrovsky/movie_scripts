           Give us that, Deagol, my love!

                      DEAGOL
           Why?

                     SMEAGOL V/0
           They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
           called us. They cursed us and drove us
           away.

             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

                        GOLLUM

                  (ecstatic)
             My Precious.

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAWN

ANGLE ON: A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the
scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up
towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

                        SAM
             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

FRODO shakes his HEAD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             I've gone and had too much!

SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING
CLOUD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        SAM
             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        SAM
             Here.

                        FRODO
             What about you?

                        SAM
                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        FRODO
             Sam.

                        SAM
                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

                        FRODO
            For what?

                       SAM
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

                       GOLLUM
            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

                        GIMLI
                  (suddenly interested)
             Salted pork?

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his

            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

             You are both honourable men.

             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

          No news of Frodo?

          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

          That Frodo is alive.

          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

                      SMEAGOL
           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

                      GOLLUM
                (prompting)
           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

                        SMEAGOL
           Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
           we come to . . .
                 (naughty excitement)
           ... the Tunnel!

                      GOLLUM
                (quiet)
           And when they go in, there's no coming out.
           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

                      SMEAGOL
           And they doesn't taste very nice, does
           they, Precious?               .

                      GOLLUM
                (sinister)
           No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She
           hungers for sweeter meats . . .

CLOSE ON: SAM . . . his EYES flicker OPEN . . .

                         GOLLUM (cont'd)
           "Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
           bones and the empty clothes, then we will
           find it . . .

                      SMEAGOL
           And take it for Me!

          For us . . .

                     SMEAGOL
          Yes, we, we meant for us . . .
               (choking cough)
          Go Hum! Go Hum!

                     GOLLUM
               (sly)
          The Precious will be ours once the
          Hobbitses are dead!

SUDDEN ANGLE ON: SAM image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS
GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT!

               (yelling)            ,Â·     .

SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM
SCREAMS . . . his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY!

                     GOLLUM
               (crying)
          No! Not! Help! Master!

ANGLE ON: FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF
GOLLUM.

                    FRODO
          No, Sam! Leave him alone!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, huddled on the ground        WHIMPERING and
SOBBING.

                      SAM
               (fuming)
          I heard it from his own mouth        he means
          to murder us!

            Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
            He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
            and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

                       SAM
            You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
            your head in!

FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

                       FRODO
            Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM pulls away from FRODO . . .

                       SAM
            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !

                       FRODO
                 (fierce whisper)
            I'm not sending him away.

SAM stares at FRODO . . . at a loss.

                       SAM
            You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

                       FRODO
                 (lowers voice)
            We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
            without a guide. I need you on my side.

ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

           I know, Sam, I know.
                (whisper)
           You must trust me.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                      FRODO (cont'd)
           Come, Smeagol.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES ... and SMILES.

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

                      MERRY
           (whispers)
           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!



EXT. EDORAS GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

On the STEPS of the GOLDEN HALL, LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN

             He is here.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,

                        GANDALF
             Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                        MERRY
             Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

                        PIPPIN
             Gandalf! Forgive me.

          courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!

FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

                        PIPPIN (cont'd)
             The city was burning ...

             Minas Tirith???
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Is that what you saw?

                  (terrified)
             I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his
             voice in my head.

                     GANDALF
          And what did you tell him? Speak!

                        PIPPIN
          He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he
          hurt me . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING
INTENSITY . . .

                    GANDALF
          What did you tell him about Frodo and the
          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    GANDALF (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN
                (low and urgent)
           I will go.

                        GANDALF

           No!

           They must be warned.

                      GANDALF
           They will be.

                (louder, to all)
           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.

INT. EDORAS STABLES - DAWN

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of
SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave . . .

                     PIPPIN
               (nervous)
          How far is Minas Tirith?

                     GANDALF
          Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
          you'd better hope we don't have one of
          those on our tail.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

                     MERRY
          Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

                     PIPPIN
          The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

                     MERRY
          I know you've run out . . . you smoke too
          much, Pip.

                     PIPPIN
          But we'11 see each other soon?

A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF.

                      PIPPIN (cont'd)
          Won't we?

                     MERRY
          I don't know . . . I don't know what's going
          to happen.

GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX.

          Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
          anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
          carry her across the Sea . . . The last
          journey of Arwen Undomiel.

SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of
a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front

As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to thin
. . . the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM
into TALL WHITE PILLARS ...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

CLOSE ON: The'CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at
ARWEN . . . it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.

that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have.

           Arwen, there is nothing for you here ...
           only death.

ARWEN shuts her eyes ... when she opens them again the VISION
is gone . . . she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

                     ELF ESCORT O.S.
           Lady Arwen?

ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her,
concerned.

                     ELF ESCORT

          Arwen?

ANGLE ON: ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with a
fierce light in her eyes . . .

                    ARWEN
          You have the gift of foresight - tell me
          what you have seen.

CLOSE ON: ELROND his face grim.                  '

          I looked into your future and I saw death.

                    ARWEN
          There is also life.                           ,

Her father turns away ...

                     ARWEN (cont'd)
          You saw there was a child . . .
          you saw my son.

ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him.
He won't look at her . . .

                        ARWEN
             But it is not lost ...

                        ELROND
             Nothing is certain.

ANGLE ON: ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands
and turns him toward her . . .

                      ARWEN
           Some things are certain. If I leave him now

             It has begun.

             This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;

             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!

             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft

                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

                      GANDALF
          You're in the service of the Steward now -
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          Peregrin Took . . .
               (under his breath)
          Guard of the Citadel!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.,

                     PIPPIN
          It's so quiet.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
          is even worse.                                L
               (tense)                                  :
          Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
          Sam?

GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR . . .

                        GANDALF
             There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
                  (grim)
             Our enemy is almost ready, his full
             strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men
             as well.

             Mercenaries from the coast . . . All will
             answer Mordor' s call.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.


                       GANDALF
             This will be the end of Gondor as we know
             it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last
bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
             If the river is taken, if the garrison at
             Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN ... desperately seeking reassurance.

                       PIPPIN
            But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
            count for something.

GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing ...

                        PIPPIN (cont'd)
                 (nervous)
            Gandalf?

GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in
his mind's eye.

INSERT IMAGE: A TOWERING, HOODED FIGURE, DRESSED in BLACK, is
being dressed in ARMOUR by attendant ORCS ...

                           GANDALF V/0
            Sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest
            servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's
            armies    in war, the one they say no living
            man can    kill.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF still staring intently as if facing his
enemy in .person.

                        GANDALF
            The Witchking of Angmar . . .

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks up at GANDALF, afraid to ask . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

ROUGH-HEWN ROAD ... GOLLUM CAREFULLY.peers OVER the lip of
the GULLY ___

ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY
KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME,
it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT - like a CORPSE CANDLE.

TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads
to the CITY ...

           Come away, come away. Look! We have found

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-
VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE ... Directly in
FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

             The secret stairs . . . climb!

SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD . . . as if some
FORCE, other than his own will, is at work! He lurches
towards the BRIDGE . . . towards MINAS MORGUL!

             No, Mr Frodo!

                  (disorientated)
             They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,
as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of
BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against

SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the

a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL

             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated

EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN ...

                     EOWYN
          Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
          the women of the Court to farewell the men.

ARAGORN smiles . . . reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal
a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her HORSE.

EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN.

                        EOWYN (cont'd)
                  (softly)
             The Men have found their Captain - they
             will follow you into battle, even to death.
                  (quietly)
             You have given us hope.

PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and
PEOPLE of EDORAS . . . it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

                       THEODEN V/0
             So . . . It is before the walls of Minas

TILT DOWN ... following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOW-
LYING, MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS!

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF ...

A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS . . . The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

GANDALF ...

                        FARAMIR   (cont'd)
             They broke through    our defences. They have
             taken the bridge a   nd the West Bank.
             Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River.

                        IORLAS
             It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long

             Foreseen and done nothing!

FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise
in his eyes.

             Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling

FARAMIR shakes his head.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER Â·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM

EYES WIDENING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                  (alarmed yell)

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

ear:

           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it

             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a

             do his Lord's will?

             Alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)
             What were you doing?

                          SMEAGOL
                  (sly)
             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

                        FRODO                              .
             It's dark still.

                        SAM
             It's always dark here -

CLOSE ON: SAM stops rummaging . . . SHOCK on his face.

           What? That's all we have left!

SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM ...

                      SAM
                (dawning realisation)
           He took it! He must have!

                      GOLLUM
                (shocked)
           Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
           hates nasty Elf bread!

                     SAM
           You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
           it?

                      FRODO
           He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
           it.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET . . .
sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!

           What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
                (fake outrage)
           He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
           always stuffing himself when Master's not

FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

CLOSE ON: SAM'S horrified face!

                       SAM
            Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
            go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's
            rest up a bit.

SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO ...

                  (exhausted)
            I ' m alright.

                      SAM
           No, no, you're not alright! You're
           exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
           place; it's that thing around your neck. I
           could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a
           while - share the load.

STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM.

                       FRODO

FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

                       GOLLUM
            See! See! He wants it for himself.

                       SAM

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

                        GUARD
             King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT ...

INT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON:- THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

                       THEODEN
             I take my leave.

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to
reveal ... ELROND.

                    ARAGORN
          My Lord, Elrond.

                       ELROND
             I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN ...

                    ELROND (cont'd)
          Arwen is dying.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news ... ASHEN-FACED.

                        ARAGORN
             She stayed?

                       ELROND
             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                       ELROND (cont'd)
             A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
             South.

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

                        ARAGORN
             There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT ...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                      ELROND
                (quietly)
           There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

                     ELROND (cont'd)
          Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from
          the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

                        ARAGORN
          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          Elendil . . .

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

                     A RAG OR N (c on t' d)
          . . . the blade that was broken shall return
          to Minas Tirith.

                      ELROND
            The man who can wield the power of this
            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . .

                      ELROND (cont'd)
            Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
            born to be - take the Dimhplt Road.

A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

                         ELROND (cont'd)
                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
            Onen i-estel Edain.
