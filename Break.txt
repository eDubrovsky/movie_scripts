                                (Pause)
                         Yes.
Shot of father and son, son in jeans, boots and vest,
long hair, early     twenties, his hair getting longer with
the progress of the movie, his features, icily handsome,
becoming more and more expressive and tender.
                         You quit.

          A :* :                (Inwardly)
                        Yea.
(A.'s small pocket knife is out, playing the edge with his
nail, shot close of his hands slightly quivering with
inner tension.)

                        I can see you're on acid,
             Father:

                        my mind is blown.
(Gently out of tension rubs the inside of his upper leg)

                                (Looking at him as he
             Father:
                               does this)
                        I think you're sick.

A. striking match, watches it burn.            Telephone      rings.
Father picks up phone.         Pause.
Strange voice hissing over the phone:

                        sssssss.
Hanging up.
Father, bothered, hanging up.            The match in A.'s hand
burns out.      Father sees it go out.
A; rising, not looking at his Father, walking to elevator
which opens directly on the luxurious apartment.

                      I need a woman, Dad. I'm
                      going out and find a woman, Dad-
F. startled, very distant, slowly wondering aloud:

                      You really are sick . . . You
                     have no idea      really of what
                      reality is.
A, turning around at entrance to elevator which opens
as he talks.                                 Then softer:
                Looking at Father hard.
                                           Right here.
                      Reality I have.
                            (Gesturing with his
                           hand to his genitals)
                      Right here.
